# MicroPython Basics Examples

This directory contains simple MicroPython example code covering basic functionality.

## Contents

- **DigitalReadSerial** - Read digital input and print to serial
- **AnalogReadSerial** - Read analog input and print to serial
- **ReadAnalogVoltage** - Read analog input and convert to voltage

*These cover basic digital and analog input, printing to serial, and voltage conversion.*

## Requirements

- MicroPython board
- Basic components like buttons, potentiometer, LEDs, resistors

## Usage

- Connect components according to the comments in each example
- Modify pin assignments and other constants as needed
- Upload code to board
- View serial output in serial monitor
- The examples print the raw digital/analog values and the calculated voltage.

## *Notes*

Great starting point for learning MicroPython
Similar code works across many boards like ESP32, ESP8266, etc.
Adjust pin numbers, calculation constants, etc. as needed
