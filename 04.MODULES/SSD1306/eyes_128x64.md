# OLED Eye Animation Readme

This Python code utilizes MicroPython to animate eyes on an SSD1306 OLED display, creating a playful visual effect.

## Dependencies

- `machine`: This module provides functions for controlling hardware components, such as pins and I2C.
- `time`: This module provides various time-related functions.
- `math`: This module is used for mathematical operations, specifically for drawing circles.
- `urandom`: This module generates random numbers, used for randomizing eye movements and blinking.
- `ssd1306`: This module enables communication with the SSD1306 OLED display over I2C.

## Installation

Ensure that MicroPython is installed on your microcontroller. Then, copy the provided code into a `.py` file on the microcontroller.

## Usage

1. Connect the SSD1306 OLED display to the microcontroller using the I2C protocol.
2. Adjust the pin numbers for the SDA and SCL lines in the code if necessary.
3. Execute the code on the microcontroller.
4. Observe the OLED display as it animates the eyes with various movements and blinking actions.

## Functionality

The code defines functions to draw eyes, animate eye movements (up, down, left, right), perform eye rolls, and simulate blinking. It generates random actions for the eyes, creating dynamic and playful animations on the OLED display.

## Usage Example

```python
from machine import Pin, I2C
import time
import math
import urandom
from ssd1306 import SSD1306_I2C

# Initialize I2C and SSD1306 display
i2c = I2C(sda=Pin(4), scl=Pin(5))
oled = SSD1306_I2C(128, 64, i2c)

# Define eye animation functions...

# Continuous eye animation loop
while True:
    action = urandom.getrandbits(5)  # Generate random action
    # Perform eye movements based on the random action...
    # Include blinking action with each other action...
```

## Notes

- Adjust the `machine.freq()` value according to your microcontroller's frequency.
- Ensure that the correct pin numbers are used for SDA and SCL lines based on your hardware setup.
- Modify the animation parameters (eye size, pupil size, delay, etc.) to customize the eye animations.
- This code is specifically tailored for MicroPython and may require modifications for other platforms or languages.
