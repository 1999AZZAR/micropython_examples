# MicroPython Examples

This repository contains a collection of MicroPython example code for various sensors, actuators, modules, and functionality.

The examples are organized into the following sections:

## Basics

Covers basic MicroPython functionality like digital I/O, analog input, serial print, etc.

- See [here](00.BASICS/readme.md) for more details.

## Digital

Digital input and output examples like blinking LEDs, reading buttons, PWM, etc.

- See [here](02.DIGITAL/README.MD) for more details.

## Analog

Reading analog data, performing voltage conversion, input smoothing, etc.

- See [here](01.ANALOGUE/README.MD) for more details.

## Controls

Basic control circuit examples like using internal pullup resistors.

- See [here](03.CONTROLS/) for more details.

## Modules

Example code using add-on MicroPython modules for various sensors, displays, motors, and more.

- See [here](04.MODULES/README.MD) for more details.

## Systems

Example code for MicroPython OS functionality like filesystem access, directories, etc.

- See [here](05.SYSTEMS/readme.md) for more details.

### Requirements

- MicroPython board (tested on ESP32, ESP8266)
- Components required for each example
